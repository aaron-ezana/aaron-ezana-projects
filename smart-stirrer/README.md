# Smart Stirrer – Viscosity Prediction
  
This is my MEng individual project focused on using machine learning to estimate liquid viscosity in real-time using sensor data from a smart magnetic stirrer.

## 🔍 Project Summary

The idea is to take sensor readings (like voltage or speed) from a magnetic stirrer and use them to estimate the viscosity of the fluid being mixed.

Instead of doing physical viscosity tests (which can be slow or expensive), the goal is to make fast predictions using data and a trained model.

## 🧠 What I'm Doing

- Collect and clean sensor data (from .csv files)
- Preprocess the data (e.g. normalization)
- Train a simple ML model in Python (scikit-learn)
- Try different features and compare model accuracy
- Show the predictions visually (optional graphs)

## 🧰 Tools I'm Using

- Python  
- pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebooks  
- GitHub for version control
